1. Feature Engineering:
   â€¢ Create technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   â€¢ Engineer lag features and rolling statistics
   â€¢ Cross-exchange correlation features

2. Model Development:
   â€¢ Start with simple baseline (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
   â€¢ Try time series specific models (ARIMA, LSTM)
   â€¢ Ensemble methods for robustness

3. Validation Strategy:
   â€¢ Time-based cross-validation
   â€¢ Walk-forward validation
   â€¢ Account for the lag structure in validation

4. Advanced Techniques:
   â€¢ Multi-output regression for related targets
   â€¢ Transfer learning between similar instruments
   â€¢ Attention mechanisms for time series
